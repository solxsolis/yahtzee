    The objective of the game is to roll certain combinations of numbers with 5 dice. At each turn you throw dice trying
to get a good combination of numbers. Different combinations give different scores.
    The game takes 13 turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate rolls of the dice. On the first roll ypu roll all
five of the dice. After the first and second rolls, you can hold any subset of the 5 dice you want, and roll the rest
trying to get a good combination. After a maximum of three rolls you must choose a category to score in. The score you get
depends on the category you choose and the combination that you have rolled. After a category has been played, you can't
use it again.
    The first column of categories contains 6 categories corresponding to one of the six face values of the dice. For
these categories the score is thr sum of the dice with the corresponding face values and ignore all the other dice. At the
